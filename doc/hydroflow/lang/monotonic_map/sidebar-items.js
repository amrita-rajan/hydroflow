window.SIDEBAR_ITEMS = {"struct":[["MonotonicMap","A map-like interface which in reality only stores one value at a time. The keys must be monotonically increasing (i.e. timestamps). For Hydroflow, this allows state to be stored which resets each tick by using the tick counter as the key. In the generic `Map` case it can be swapped out for a true map to allow processing of multiple ticks of data at once."]]};
